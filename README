program memory.

About Laser Puzzle

Laser Puzzle is a Uzebox implementation of a laser-based puzzle
game. It has 40 levels, and the object is to place pieces on the board
in such a way that the laser beam is deflected into one or two targets
from the proper direction. Pieces that aren't fixed in place
(indicated by a lock icon) may be dragged and dropped onto any blank
square, or rotated to face any direction. In order to properly solve
each puzzle, the laser beam must pass through all of the pieces that
aren't blockers. This game is more kid-friendly than Laser Puzzle II.

Play Laser Puzzle

If you don't have a Uzebox video game console, you can play it using
an online Uzebox emulator: https://artcfox.github.io/laser/

Using a keyboard is preferred, but the touch controls should allow you
to at least preview the gameplay if you are on a mobile device. The
native desktop emulator supports USB SNES game controllers, or you can
build your own Uzebox game console: https://uzebox.org/
